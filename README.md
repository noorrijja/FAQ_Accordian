### The challenge

- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Java Script

### What I learned

The thing I found interesting and enjoyed learning during this project was the HTML DOM Element firstElementChild Property.

### Code Snippet:

    const content = this.nextElementSibling;

    const a = this.firstElementChild;
    const plusButton = a.firstElementChild;

    const b = this.firstElementChild;
    const minusButton = b.lastElementChild;

### Continued development

While working on future projects I would like giving a boost to my responsive web design skills as well as improving the accessibilty of the design.
